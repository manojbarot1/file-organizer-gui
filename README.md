### 2. **Enhanced AI Integration**
- Multiple AI backends: Local (Ollama), OpenAI, Grok
- Optimized prompts for each backend
- Better response parsing and validation
- Retry logic with exponential backoff

### 3. **Smart Project Detection**

4. **Select Folder**
   - Click "Select Folder" to choose the directory to organize
   - The app will analyze the folder structure automatically

5. **Configure Options**
   - **Use Context**: Enable to consider file context and project structure
   - **Consider Structure**: Adapt suggestions to existing folder patterns
   - **Smart Grouping**: Group related files together
   - **Refine Suggestions**: Use two-pass AI for better accuracy

6. **Scan with AI**
   - Click "Scan with AI" to analyze all files
   - Watch the progress as files are processed
   - Review suggestions in the tree view

7. **Review and Organize**
   - Check the suggested paths for each file
   - Use "Select All" or manually select files
   - Click "Organize" to move files to their suggested locations

## üîß Configuration Options

### AI Backend Settings
- **Local (Ollama)**: Fast, private, no API costs
- **OpenAI**: High quality, requires API key
- **Grok**: xAI's model, requires API key

### Organization Options
- **Use Context**: Consider file location and project structure
- **Consider Structure**: Adapt to existing folder naming patterns
- **Smart Grouping**: Group related files together
- **Refine Suggestions**: Use two-pass AI for better accuracy

### Advanced Settings
- **Cache Management**: Clear cache for fresh AI suggestions
- **Export Options**: Export organization plans to CSV
- **Logging**: Detailed logs for debugging

## üìÅ Supported Project Types

The organizer automatically detects and provides specialized organization for:

### Development Projects
- **Python**: src/, tests/, docs/, config/
- **Node.js**: src/, lib/, test/, docs/
- **Go**: cmd/, pkg/, internal/, test/
- **Rust**: src/, tests/, examples/, docs/
- **Java (Maven/Gradle)**: src/main/, src/test/, docs/
- **Terraform**: terraform/, modules/, environments/

### General Organization
- **Documents**: docs/, reports/, presentations/
- **Media**: images/, audio/, video/, assets/
- **Archives**: backups/, old/, archive/
- **Configuration**: config/, settings/, env/

## üéØ File Categories

The organizer recognizes and categorizes:

### Code Files
- Source code (.py, .js, .java, .cpp, .go, .rs, etc.)
- Configuration files (.json, .yaml, .toml, .env)
- Documentation (.md, .txt, .rst, .pdf)
- Scripts and executables

### Media Files
- Images (.jpg, .png, .gif, .svg, etc.)
- Audio (.mp3, .wav, .flac, etc.)
- Video (.mp4, .avi, .mov, etc.)

### Project Files
- Build files (Makefile, Dockerfile, etc.)
- Dependencies (requirements.txt, package.json, etc.)
- Version control (.gitignore, .gitattributes)

## üîç How It Works

### 1. Project Analysis
The organizer starts by analyzing the selected folder:
- Detects project type based on root files
- Analyzes existing folder structure
- Identifies naming conventions
- Maps file relationships

### 2. Context Extraction
For each file, it extracts comprehensive context:
- File type and category
- Current location and depth
- Sibling files and relationships
- Project-specific patterns

### 3. AI Processing
The AI receives detailed prompts including:
- File information and context
- Project type and guidelines
- Existing structure patterns
- Smart grouping rules

### 4. Response Processing
AI responses are processed and validated:
- Path extraction and cleaning
- Structure-aware adjustments
- Validation and fallbacks
- Optional refinement pass

### 5. Organization
Files are moved to their suggested locations:
- Creates necessary directories
- Handles naming conflicts
- Preserves file relationships
- Provides progress feedback

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Ollama Connection Failed**
- Ensure Ollama is running: `ollama serve`
- Check if models are installed: `ollama list`
- Install a model: `ollama pull llama3.1`

**OpenAI/Grok API Errors**
- Verify your API key is correct
- Check your account has sufficient credits
- Ensure the model name is correct

**File Permission Errors**
- Run with appropriate permissions
- Check folder write access
- Ensure files aren't locked by other processes

**Poor AI Suggestions**
- Enable "Use Context" and "Consider Structure"
- Try different AI models
- Use "Refine Suggestions" for better accuracy
- Clear cache and rescan

### Debug Mode
Enable detailed logging by checking the console output or temp log files in your system's temp directory.

## üìä Performance Tips

### For Large Folders
- Use local Ollama for faster processing
- Disable "Refine Suggestions" for speed
- Process in smaller batches
- Use SSD storage for better I/O

### For Better Accuracy
- Enable all context options
- Use higher-quality AI models
- Enable refinement for complex projects
- Provide clear project structure
